# Arbetsförmedlingen MCP Server

MCP server for the Swedish labour market. Built on [Arbetsförmedlingen](https://arbetsformedlingen.se) and [JobTech Dev](https://data.arbetsformedlingen.se/) open APIs.

Gives Claude and other MCP-compatible AI assistants 13 tools for searching jobs, streaming real-time events, AI-analysing job ads, and navigating the Swedish occupation taxonomy.

No API key required. All APIs are publicly accessible.
